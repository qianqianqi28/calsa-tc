The data about an authorship attribution is from link url = {https://github.com/mikekestemont/anthem}. 
The "verification" folder is part of "anthem-master.zip". In "verification" folder, all data is recogonized into "wilh_background" folder and "wilh_test" folder. It is worth noting that in the folder of "verification\wilh_test\datheen" there are songs from Datheen, and the "wilhelmus.txt".
We reorganized the data from "verification" folder according to the authors. We create "data" folder to restore these documents. In the "data" folder, there are six folders and the "wilhelmus.txt" file. The six folders are datheen (35 .txt files), marnix (46 .txt files), heere (23 .txt files), haecht (35 .txt files), fruytiers (33 .txt files), coornhert (14 .txt files).
We use data in "data" folder for our research.
